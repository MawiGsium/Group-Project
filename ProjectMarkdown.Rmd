## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

# Finally It is Over
## What do you mean?
### I know How to Do it!!

**Great** *Brother*

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
library(viridis)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

## Viridis colors

```{r}
image( volcano, col = viridis(200))
```

## Magma colors

```{r fig.cap = "The Maunga Whau volcano, Auckland."}
image( volcano, col = viridis(200, option = "A"))
```

#### KeyBoard to creat the code chunk (cmd + option + i)


```{r}
print ("Hellow Mawina")
```
